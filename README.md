# AB-DOC

AB-DOC is a serverless UI to AWS S3, written in JavaScript (jQuery). ABâ€‘DOC allows you to create documents online and organize them in a tree structure. You can store your thoughts, information, or whatever. All users' data is stored in Amazon S3 storage. 

Simple and powerful! No servers, no API Gateway, just you, your browser, and S3 :smiley:
